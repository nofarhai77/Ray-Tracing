# Ray-Tracing

Ray Tracer project, implemented in Java. Written as a project for the course Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, Image Processing, and Vision (Tel Aviv University).

This program renders an image from a 3d model that describes objects in the 3d space. This program uses a technique called ray tracing. This technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism, but in some cases it requires a relatively high computational cost.
