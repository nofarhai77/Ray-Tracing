# Ray-Tracing

This program renders three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional images. It uses a technique called ray tracing, that simulates the behavior of light as it interacts with objects in a 3D scene. It traces the path of light rays from the viewer's perspective or light sources, calculating how they reflect, refract, and illuminate objects to create realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections in virtual environments.
This technique is capable of producing a high degree of visual realism, but in some cases it requires a relatively high computational cost.
The project implemented in Java, and has been Written as an assignment for the course "Graphics, Computer Vision, and Image Processing" at Tel Aviv University.
